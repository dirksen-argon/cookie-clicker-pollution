<h1>Pollution Clicker</h1>
<p>Inspiration: Cookie Clicker, Extra Credits

What it does: Demonstrates the urgency of pollution

How we built it: Written in python using pygame

Challenges we ran into: We had major technical issues getting it into an executable, and we were learning how to use pygame as we went, and we had a lot of problems with GitHub overwriting files

Accomplishments we’re proud of: List counting generators in the top left, the mouse turns to a hand when it hovers over clickable items, and the way the music turned out

What we learned: We’re much more acquainted with how GitHub works, as well as pygame, and we now know a little bit more about executables

What’s next for Pollution Clicker: As Extra Credits once said, every system in a game, every action the player can and can’t take, is a message to the player. There is so much deep meaning that can be put into video games that we have only just scratched the surface of. Games can make us laugh, make us cry, and most importantly in this case, make us understand. So many in the world do not understand the weight of pollution on the earth, and because of that very little is being done. Using interactive experiences, we can help those to better see the world around them.</p>
